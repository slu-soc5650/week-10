# lab-09

## Introduction
This is the replication for `lab-09`. Data on U.S. state capitals are projected and previewed using `R` before being added to a map of health insurance rates by county for all 50 states.

## Data

* the `stateCapitals.csv` data were obtained from the `lecture-10` repository; Chris included them after finding the `.csv` file on GitHub
